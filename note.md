# Reducing Errors in Self-Service Kiosks: A Human Factors Approach

## Introduction

Self-service kiosks have become ubiquitous in modern society, appearing in restaurants, retail stores, airports, healthcare facilities, and numerous other public spaces. These interactive devices allow customers to access information or services without requiring direct human assistance. The proliferation of self-service technology has been driven by multiple factors: businesses seek to reduce operational costs, improve service efficiency, and address labor shortages, while many customers appreciate the convenience, speed, and autonomy these systems can provide.

However, the widespread implementation of self-service kiosks has introduced a complex set of challenges related to human-computer interaction. Despite their potential benefits, these systems frequently generate errors and frustrations that can negatively impact user experience, business operations, and accessibility. Research indicates that 43% of shoppers require assistance when using self-service checkouts, and many users experience significant frustration when encountering system errors or navigational difficulties (LamasaTech, n.d.).

This report examines the problem of errors in self-service kiosk interactions through the lens of human factors engineering. Human factors is concerned with understanding the interactions between humans and other elements of a system to optimize human well-being and overall system performance. By applying human factors approaches to self-service kiosk design and implementation, we can identify, analyze, and address the root causes of errors, ultimately creating more inclusive, efficient, and satisfying user experiences.

### Problem Context

Self-service kiosk errors manifest in various forms and stem from multiple sources. These errors can be broadly categorized into:

1. **User-generated errors**: Mistakes made by users due to confusion, misunderstanding, or physical limitations
2. **System-generated errors**: Technical failures, software bugs, or hardware malfunctions
3. **Design-induced errors**: Problems arising from poor interface design, inadequate feedback, or complex navigation
4. **Environmental errors**: Issues caused by contextual factors such as lighting, noise, or space constraints
5. **Interaction errors**: Problems occurring at the boundary between user actions and system responses

The consequences of these errors extend beyond mere inconvenience. For users, they can lead to frustration, wasted time, abandoned transactions, and exclusion of individuals with disabilities or limited technical literacy. For businesses, kiosk errors result in lost revenue, increased staff intervention costs, negative customer experiences, and damaged brand reputation.

The complexity of this problem space is compounded by the diversity of users interacting with self-service kiosks. Users vary significantly in their physical abilities, cognitive capabilities, technical familiarity, language proficiency, and cultural backgrounds. A one-size-fits-all approach to kiosk design inevitably creates barriers for certain user groups.

### Objectives and Approach

This report aims to:

1. Analyze the problem space of self-service kiosk errors through a rich contextual understanding
2. Apply appropriate human factors approaches to identify and address error sources
3. Develop practical recommendations for reducing errors and improving user experience
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions and identify lessons learned

To achieve these objectives, the report employs three complementary human factors approaches:

1. **Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)**: A holistic approach for understanding complex socio-technical problems where different stakeholders have divergent perspectives
2. **Usability Evaluation Methods (UEM)**: Systematic techniques for assessing and improving the usability of interactive systems
3. **Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)**: A structured method for breaking down complex tasks into subtasks and analyzing potential error points

By integrating these approaches, this report provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing the multifaceted challenges of self-service kiosk errors, ultimately contributing to more inclusive, efficient, and satisfying user experiences.
# Literature Review: Self-Service Kiosks and Error Reduction

## Overview of Self-Service Kiosks

Self-service kiosks are interactive devices that feature a screen allowing customers to access information or services without the need to interact with a sales assistant or service provider. These technologies have become increasingly prevalent across various sectors including retail, healthcare, transportation, hospitality, and government services. According to LamasaTech (n.d.), 67% of those who have used a self-service checkout say they are convenient, with millennials showing the highest adoption rates.

The proliferation of self-service kiosks has been driven by several factors:

1. **Business efficiency**: Kiosks can reduce operational costs by automating routine transactions and freeing staff for more complex tasks
2. **Customer experience**: When properly implemented, kiosks can reduce waiting times by up to 40% (LamasaTech, n.d.)
3. **Labor shortages**: Kiosks help businesses maintain service levels despite staffing challenges
4. **Pandemic response**: Touchless and low-contact service options became particularly valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic
5. **Technological advancement**: Improvements in touch screen technology, artificial intelligence, and user interface design have made kiosks more capable and accessible

## Common Errors in Self-Service Kiosk Interactions

Despite their potential benefits, self-service kiosks frequently generate errors that impact user experience and operational efficiency. Research by Wavetec (2025) identified several key challenges in kiosk user experience design:

### 1. Empathy Gap

The empathy gap occurs when designers overlook users' needs and focus too much on functionality or business goals. This disconnect leads to interfaces that may work technically but fail to accommodate real-world user behaviors and limitations. For example, older adults or less tech-savvy individuals often struggle with unclear navigation or small icons, resulting in abandoned transactions (Wavetec, 2025).

### 2. Complex Navigation

Long or complicated menus with too many options overwhelm users and lead to navigation errors. Research on airport kiosks found that passengers frequently struggled with multi-screen processes required to confirm flight details (Wavetec, 2025). Lee et al. (2023) found that in a study of self-ordering kiosks in fast food restaurants, 33% of participants indicated they were unclear about the operation process, and the kiosk prompts were not clear enough to prevent uncertainty.

### 3. Accessibility Issues

Features like small text or touch interfaces that require fine motor skills create significant barriers for users with disabilities. Lee et al. (2023) conducted a comparative analysis of kiosk accessibility and found that many kiosks failed to accommodate users with visual, hearing, or physical impairments. Their research emphasized that accessibility should not be treated as a subset of usability but as a fundamental design requirement.

### 4. Environmental Constraints

The physical environment significantly affects kiosk usability. Kiosks placed in direct sunlight suffer from screen glare, while cramped spaces make it difficult for users to approach or interact with the device (Wavetec, 2025). These environmental factors are often overlooked in design but have major impacts on error rates.

### 5. Technical Failures

System crashes, software bugs, and hardware malfunctions represent a significant source of errors. Research by Lee et al. (2023) found that 37% of participants could not find the shopping cart at the bottom of the interface and could not confirm the scanner's location when redeeming e-coupons, indicating both design and technical implementation issues.

## Psychological Factors in User Response to Errors

Chen et al. (2021) conducted research on how users respond to service failures in self-service technologies compared to human service providers. Their findings revealed several important psychological dimensions:

1. **Differential error tolerance**: Customers have more negative responses to self-service technology failures than to employee failures
2. **Emotional responses**: Users get angrier with machines' mistakes than with those of humans
3. **Empathy effects**: Empathy alleviates anger and negative responses in employee failure scenarios, but not in self-service technology failures
4. **Attribution patterns**: Users tend to attribute machine errors to fundamental flaws rather than circumstantial factors

These psychological patterns help explain why even minor errors in self-service kiosks can lead to disproportionately negative user experiences and abandoned transactions.

## Human Factors Approaches to Error Reduction

The literature identifies several human factors approaches that have proven effective in addressing self-service kiosk errors:

### Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)

Soft Systems Methodology, developed by Peter Checkland and Brian Wilson, provides a framework for addressing "soft" ill-defined problems where different stakeholders have divergent views on what constitutes the system, its purpose, and therefore the problem (Burge, 2015). SSM has been applied to various service design challenges, including self-service technologies, to create a holistic understanding of complex socio-technical systems.

### Usability Evaluation Methods (UEM)

Usability evaluation methods encompass a range of techniques for assessing and improving the usability of interactive systems. The System Usability Scale (SUS), developed by John Brooke, has become one of the most widely used tools for measuring perceived usability (Digital Healthcare Research, n.d.). Lee et al. (2023) employed SUS alongside other evaluation methods to assess self-ordering kiosks, finding that none of the evaluated systems met acceptable usability standards.

### Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)

Hierarchical Task Analysis breaks down complex tasks into a hierarchy of goals, operations, and plans. This structured approach helps identify potential error points in user journeys and informs the design of more intuitive interfaces. Research by Lee et al. (2023) demonstrated the value of task analysis in understanding the specific challenges users face when navigating self-ordering kiosks.

## Emerging Trends and Best Practices

Recent literature points to several emerging trends and best practices in reducing self-service kiosk errors:

1. **Inclusive design**: Designing for diverse user groups from the outset rather than retrofitting accessibility features
2. **Multimodal interaction**: Providing multiple ways to interact with kiosks (touch, voice, gesture) to accommodate different user needs and preferences
3. **Intelligent assistance**: Implementing AI-powered help systems that can detect when users are struggling and offer contextual guidance
4. **Error prevention**: Designing interfaces that make it difficult to make errors in the first place, rather than focusing solely on error recovery
5. **Balanced automation**: Maintaining appropriate human support alongside self-service options, with 53% of shoppers wanting to see at least one staff member overseeing self-service checkouts (LamasaTech, n.d.)

## Research Gaps

Despite the growing body of literature on self-service kiosk errors, several research gaps remain:

1. Limited longitudinal studies on how users learn and adapt to self-service systems over time
2. Insufficient research on cultural differences in self-service kiosk usage and error patterns
3. Need for more standardized metrics and methodologies for evaluating kiosk usability across different contexts
4. Limited investigation of the relationship between error reduction and business outcomes

This report aims to address some of these gaps by applying a comprehensive human factors approach to the problem of self-service kiosk errors.
# Selected Human Factors Approaches

## Approach Selection and Justification

After thorough research into the problem space of self-service kiosk errors, three complementary human factors approaches have been selected to address this complex socio-technical challenge:

1. Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)
2. Usability Evaluation Methods (UEM)
3. Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)

These approaches were selected based on their proven effectiveness in addressing similar challenges, their complementary strengths, and their ability to address different aspects of the problem space. The following sections provide a detailed justification for each approach and explain how they will be applied to reduce errors in self-service kiosks.

## Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)

### Overview

Soft Systems Methodology, developed by Peter Checkland and Brian Wilson at Lancaster University, is a systematic approach for tackling complex problematic situations where different stakeholders have divergent perspectives on what constitutes the system, its purpose, and therefore the problem (Burge, 2015). Unlike "hard" systems approaches that assume well-defined problems, SSM recognizes that in many real-world situations, the very definition of the problem is contested.

### Justification for Selection

SSM is particularly well-suited for addressing self-service kiosk errors for several reasons:

1. **Multiple stakeholder perspectives**: The kiosk ecosystem involves diverse stakeholders (users, business owners, staff, designers, technical support) with different priorities and definitions of success. SSM provides a framework for reconciling these perspectives.

2. **Socio-technical complexity**: Kiosk errors emerge from the interaction of technical systems, human behavior, organizational policies, and environmental factors. SSM's holistic approach can capture these complex interdependencies.

3. **Ill-defined problem boundaries**: The boundaries between user errors, system failures, and design flaws are often blurred in kiosk interactions. SSM helps navigate this ambiguity by focusing on the problematic situation rather than assuming a clear-cut problem definition.

4. **Transformation focus**: SSM emphasizes understanding how inputs are transformed into outputs within a system, which aligns well with analyzing how user intentions are transformed into completed transactions (or errors) in kiosk interactions.

### Application to Self-Service Kiosk Errors

In this report, SSM is applied through the following key components:

1. **Rich Picture**: A visual representation of the self-service kiosk error ecosystem, capturing the relationships between users, kiosk interface, staff, business objectives, technical support, error types, environmental factors, and design issues. This rich picture helps stakeholders develop a shared understanding of the problematic situation.

2. **CATWOE Analysis**: An examination of the Customers (kiosk users), Actors (staff, designers), Transformation process (from user need to fulfilled service), Worldview (assumptions about self-service), Owners (businesses), and Environmental constraints (physical and organizational limitations).

3. **Root Definition**: A concise statement defining the kiosk system from different perspectives, clarifying its purpose, constraints, and measures of success.

4. **Conceptual Models**: Idealized models of what the system should do to fulfill its purpose, which can be compared with the actual situation to identify gaps and improvement opportunities.

## Usability Evaluation Methods (UEM)

### Overview

Usability Evaluation Methods comprise a range of techniques for assessing and improving the usability of interactive systems. These methods provide systematic ways to identify usability problems, measure user performance, and gather user feedback on system interfaces.

### Justification for Selection

UEM is an essential approach for addressing self-service kiosk errors for the following reasons:

1. **Direct focus on user-interface interaction**: Many kiosk errors stem from usability issues in the interface design. UEM provides proven techniques for identifying and addressing these issues.

2. **Quantifiable metrics**: UEM offers standardized metrics like the System Usability Scale (SUS) that allow for objective measurement of usability improvements over time.

3. **Iterative improvement**: UEM supports an iterative design process where interfaces can be continuously refined based on evaluation findings, leading to progressive error reduction.

4. **Complementary to SSM**: While SSM provides a holistic view of the problem situation, UEM offers specific tools for addressing the interface design aspects of the problem.

### Application to Self-Service Kiosk Errors

In this report, UEM is applied through the following key components:

1. **System Usability Scale (SUS)**: A standardized 10-question survey for measuring perceived usability, which can be used to establish baseline usability metrics and track improvements.

2. **Think-aloud protocol**: A method where users verbalize their thoughts while completing tasks on the kiosk, revealing cognitive processes and points of confusion that lead to errors.

3. **Heuristic evaluation**: Expert review of kiosk interfaces based on established usability principles, identifying potential usability issues before they cause user errors.

4. **Task completion analysis**: Measurement of success rates, time-on-task, and error rates for specific kiosk tasks, providing quantitative data on usability problems.

## Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)

### Overview

Hierarchical Task Analysis is a structured method for breaking down complex tasks into a hierarchy of goals, operations, and plans. HTA provides a detailed understanding of the steps users must take to complete tasks and the cognitive and physical demands of each step.

### Justification for Selection

HTA is particularly valuable for addressing self-service kiosk errors for these reasons:

1. **Process-oriented view**: HTA focuses on the sequence of actions required to complete tasks, helping identify where in the process errors are most likely to occur.

2. **Cognitive load analysis**: By breaking down tasks into subtasks, HTA reveals points where cognitive demands may exceed user capabilities, leading to errors.

3. **Error prediction**: HTA enables systematic prediction of potential errors at each step of the task, facilitating proactive error prevention.

4. **Complementary to other approaches**: HTA provides the detailed task-level analysis that complements SSM's holistic view and UEM's interface-focused evaluation.

### Application to Self-Service Kiosk Errors

In this report, HTA is applied through the following key components:

1. **Task decomposition**: Breaking down the process of using a self-service kiosk into a hierarchy of tasks and subtasks, from approaching the kiosk to completing the transaction.

2. **Plan analysis**: Documenting the sequence and conditions under which subtasks are performed, revealing potential points of confusion in the user journey.

3. **Error identification**: Analyzing each subtask to identify potential errors, their consequences, and their likelihood.

4. **Redesign recommendations**: Developing specific recommendations for task flow redesign to reduce error potential at critical points.

## Integration of Approaches

These three approaches are not applied in isolation but are integrated to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding and addressing self-service kiosk errors:

1. SSM provides the holistic understanding of the problem situation and stakeholder perspectives.
2. UEM offers specific tools for evaluating and improving the kiosk interface.
3. HTA delivers detailed analysis of the task structure and potential error points.

Together, these approaches address the technical, cognitive, social, and organizational factors that contribute to self-service kiosk errors, leading to more effective and sustainable solutions.
# Application of Human Factors Approaches

## Application of Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)

### Rich Picture Analysis

The rich picture diagram (Figure 1) provides a visual representation of the self-service kiosk error ecosystem. This visualization captures the complex relationships between various stakeholders and elements in the system:

- **Users**: Diverse in abilities, technical literacy, and age groups
- **Kiosk Interface**: The central technological component
- **Staff Support**: Personnel who assist when errors occur
- **Business Objectives**: Efficiency and cost considerations driving kiosk implementation
- **Technical Support**: Maintenance and troubleshooting resources
- **Error Types**: Various categories of errors that manifest in kiosk usage
- **Environmental Factors**: External conditions affecting kiosk usage
- **Design Issues**: Interface and interaction problems

The rich picture reveals several key insights about the problem situation:

1. **Multiple feedback loops**: Errors trigger staff intervention, which creates additional workload and undermines the efficiency goals of self-service implementation.

2. **Competing priorities**: Business objectives (efficiency, cost reduction) sometimes conflict with user needs (accessibility, ease of use), creating tension in the system.

3. **Environmental influences**: External factors like lighting, noise, and space constraints significantly impact user experience but are often overlooked in kiosk design.

4. **Error propagation**: Initial design issues lead to user confusion, which generates errors, creating a cascading effect that impacts the entire system.

5. **Stakeholder disconnection**: Technical support and business decision-makers are often removed from the direct user experience, creating an empathy gap.

### CATWOE Analysis

Based on the rich picture, a CATWOE analysis provides further structure to understanding the system:

**Customers**:
- Primary: Kiosk users (diverse in abilities, age, technical literacy)
- Secondary: Businesses implementing kiosks

**Actors**:
- Kiosk users
- Support staff
- Technical maintenance personnel
- Interface designers
- Business managers

**Transformation Process**:
- Input: User need for service or transaction
- Process: Interaction with self-service kiosk
- Output: Completed transaction or abandoned attempt

**Worldview**:
- Self-service technology improves efficiency and reduces costs
- Users prefer autonomy and reduced wait times
- Technology should be accessible to all users

**Owners**:
- Businesses implementing the kiosks
- Technology providers and designers

**Environmental Constraints**:
- Physical environment (lighting, noise, space)
- Technical limitations
- Regulatory requirements (accessibility standards)
- Business resource constraints

### Root Definition

Based on the CATWOE analysis, we can formulate a root definition of the system:

"A self-service kiosk system owned by businesses, operated by diverse users, and supported by staff and technical personnel, that transforms service needs into completed transactions through digital interaction, within the constraints of the physical environment and technical capabilities, in order to achieve efficient service delivery while maintaining positive user experience."

### Conceptual Model

The conceptual model derived from this root definition identifies the following essential activities for an effective self-service kiosk system:

1. Understand diverse user needs and capabilities
2. Design intuitive interfaces that minimize cognitive load
3. Provide clear feedback on system status and user actions
4. Detect potential errors before they occur
5. Offer graceful error recovery paths
6. Monitor system performance and user experience
7. Continuously improve based on usage data and feedback
8. Maintain appropriate human support for complex situations

Comparing this conceptual model with the actual situation revealed in the rich picture highlights several gaps:

1. Limited understanding of diverse user needs (empathy gap)
2. Interfaces designed for efficiency rather than error prevention
3. Inadequate feedback mechanisms
4. Reactive rather than proactive approach to errors
5. Limited pathways for error recovery
6. Insufficient monitoring of user experience
7. Inconsistent improvement processes

These gaps represent opportunities for intervention to reduce errors in self-service kiosks.

## Application of Usability Evaluation Methods (UEM)

### System Usability Scale Assessment

Based on research findings, many self-service kiosks would score poorly on the System Usability Scale (SUS), with scores below the acceptable threshold of 68 (out of 100). Common issues that would lower SUS scores include:

1. Perceived complexity of the interface
2. Inconsistency in design elements
3. Need for technical support to complete basic tasks
4. Steep learning curve
5. Lack of confidence when using the system

### Heuristic Evaluation

A heuristic evaluation based on Nielsen's usability heuristics reveals several common usability violations in self-service kiosks:

1. **Visibility of system status**: Kiosks often fail to keep users informed about what is happening through appropriate feedback.

2. **Match between system and the real world**: Technical terminology and system-oriented language create barriers for non-technical users.

3. **User control and freedom**: Limited options for undoing actions or returning to previous steps when errors occur.

4. **Consistency and standards**: Inconsistent interface elements and interaction patterns across different screens.

5. **Error prevention**: Insufficient proactive measures to prevent errors before they occur.

6. **Recognition rather than recall**: Heavy reliance on user memory rather than making options visible.

7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use**: Lack of shortcuts or personalized options for frequent users.

8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design**: Cluttered interfaces with irrelevant information that competes for attention.

9. **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: Cryptic error messages that don't explain the problem or suggest solutions.

10. **Help and documentation**: Inadequate or inaccessible help resources.

### Think-Aloud Protocol Findings

Think-aloud sessions with users typically reveal several cognitive and emotional patterns when interacting with self-service kiosks:

1. **Hesitation points**: Users pause and express uncertainty at key decision points, indicating potential design issues.

2. **Frustration triggers**: Specific interface elements or interactions that consistently generate negative emotional responses.

3. **Mental model mismatches**: User expectations that don't align with the system's actual behavior.

4. **Workarounds**: Creative but inefficient strategies users develop to overcome perceived system limitations.

5. **Abandonment thresholds**: Points at which users decide to give up and seek human assistance.

These findings provide valuable insights into the cognitive and emotional aspects of kiosk errors that might not be captured through purely quantitative methods.

## Application of Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)

### Task Decomposition

The Hierarchical Task Analysis diagram (Figure 2) breaks down the process of using a self-service kiosk into a structured hierarchy of tasks and subtasks:

**0. Complete purchase using self-service kiosk**
- **1. Approach and initiate interaction**
 - 1.1 Locate kiosk
 - 1.2 Touch screen to start
 - 1.3 Select language (if applicable)
- **2. Browse and select items**
 - 2.1 Navigate menu categories
 - 2.2 Find desired items
 - 2.3 Select items to add to cart
- **3. Customize order**
 - 3.1 View customization options
 - 3.2 Select modifications
 - 3.3 Confirm customization
- **4. Review order**
 - 4.1 View order summary
 - 4.2 Modify quantities or remove items
 - 4.3 Add additional items
 - 4.4 Proceed to checkout
- **5. Make payment**
 - 5.1 Select payment method
 - 5.2 Process payment
 - 5.3 Wait for confirmation
- **6. Collect receipt and order**
 - 6.1 Collect printed receipt
 - 6.2 Note order number
 - 6.3 Wait for order completion

### Error Analysis

The HTA diagram identifies five critical error points in the kiosk interaction process:

1. **Unresponsive touch screen** (Task 1.2): Physical interface issues that prevent users from even beginning the interaction.

2. **Complex navigation structure** (Task 2.1): Confusing menu organization that makes it difficult for users to find desired items.

3. **Unclear customization options** (Task 3.2): Ambiguous or poorly explained modification choices that lead to incorrect selections.

4. **Difficulty modifying order** (Task 4.2): Unintuitive processes for changing quantities or removing items that frustrate users.

5. **Payment processing failure** (Task 5.2): Technical issues during the payment step that can result in transaction abandonment.

### Plan Analysis

The HTA also includes plans that specify the sequence and conditions for executing subtasks:

- **Plan 0**: Do 1-6 in sequence
- **Plan 1**: Do 1.1, then 1.2, then 1.3 if needed
- **Plan 2**: Do 2.1, then 2.2, then 2.3 repeatedly until all items selected
- **Plan 3**: For each item, do 3.1, then 3.2 if needed, then 3.3
- **Plan 4**: Do 4.1, then 4.2 and 4.3 as needed, then 4.4
- **Plan 5**: Do 5.1, then 5.2, then 5.3
- **Plan 6**: Do 6.1, then 6.2, then 6.3

These plans reveal the conditional nature of many subtasks and the potential for users to get lost in loops or decision points, particularly in Plans 2, 3, and 4 where repetition or optional steps are involved.

### Cognitive Load Analysis

Analyzing the cognitive demands of each task reveals several high-load points in the interaction:

1. **Navigation decision points** (Task 2.1): Users must understand menu categorization and remember where items are located.

2. **Customization decisions** (Task 3.2): Users must comprehend multiple options and their implications while holding their preferences in working memory.

3. **Order review** (Task 4.1-4.3): Users must verify multiple items, quantities, and customizations while deciding whether changes are needed.

4. **Payment method selection** (Task 5.1): Users must evaluate different payment options while potentially feeling time pressure from other waiting customers.

These high cognitive load points correlate strongly with the identified error points, suggesting that cognitive overload is a significant contributor to kiosk errors.
# Analysis and Recommendations

## Integrated Analysis of Findings

The application of Soft Systems Methodology (SSM), Usability Evaluation Methods (UEM), and Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) has revealed a comprehensive picture of the factors contributing to errors in self-service kiosks. By integrating the findings from these three approaches, we can identify several key themes and patterns:

### 1. Systemic Error Patterns

The analysis reveals that kiosk errors are not isolated incidents but emerge from complex interactions between users, technology, environment, and organizational factors. Key systemic patterns include:

- **Cascading errors**: Initial minor usability issues often trigger cascading errors as users become frustrated and make additional mistakes.
- **Feedback loops**: Error situations create intervention needs that strain staff resources, undermining the efficiency goals of self-service implementation.
- **Stakeholder disconnects**: Gaps in understanding between kiosk designers, business owners, and end users create systems that prioritize business efficiency over user experience.
- **Environmental amplifiers**: Physical context factors like lighting, noise, and space constraints amplify the impact of interface design issues.

### 2. Critical Error Points

By combining the rich picture analysis with the HTA error identification, five critical error points emerge as priorities for intervention:

- **Initiation barriers**: Physical and perceptual issues that prevent users from successfully starting the interaction
- **Navigation complexity**: Confusing information architecture that impedes users' ability to find what they need
- **Customization confusion**: Poorly designed modification interfaces that lead to incorrect selections
- **Modification obstacles**: Unintuitive processes for changing or correcting selections
- **Payment failures**: Technical and usability issues during the critical transaction phase

### 3. Cognitive and Emotional Factors

The analysis highlights the importance of cognitive and emotional factors in kiosk errors:

- **Cognitive load spikes**: Specific points in the interaction where information processing demands exceed user capabilities
- **Anxiety amplification**: Environmental and social pressures (like queues forming behind users) that increase stress and error likelihood
- **Learned helplessness**: Repeated error experiences that lead users to expect failure and avoid future kiosk use
- **Attribution patterns**: Users' tendency to blame themselves for errors, leading to negative self-perception and technology avoidance

### 4. Accessibility Gaps

The integrated analysis reveals significant accessibility gaps that contribute to errors for users with disabilities:

- **Visual accessibility**: Insufficient contrast, small text, and lack of screen reader compatibility
- **Motor control assumptions**: Interface designs that require precise fine motor control
- **Cognitive accessibility**: Complex task flows that create barriers for users with cognitive impairments
- **Sensory feedback limitations**: Over-reliance on a single sensory channel (usually visual) for system feedback

## Recommendations for Error Reduction

Based on the integrated analysis, the following recommendations are proposed to reduce errors in self-service kiosks:

### 1. Design Recommendations

#### Interface Design

- **Progressive disclosure**: Present only necessary information at each step to reduce cognitive load

# Evaluation and Conclusion

## Evaluation of Human Factors Approaches

The three human factors approaches applied in this reporteach contributed unique insights to understanding and addressing errors in self-service kiosks. This section evaluates the effectiveness of these approaches and their integration.

### Effectiveness of Soft Systems Methodology

**Strengths:**
- Provided a holistic view of the kiosk ecosystem, capturing the complex interrelationships between stakeholders
- Revealed systemic patterns that would not be apparent from a narrower analysis
- Identified competing priorities and tensions in the system that contribute to errors
- Created a shared understanding of the problem situation across different perspectives

**Limitations:**
- High level of abstraction sometimes made it challenging to connect insights to specific design interventions
- Required significant interpretation to translate conceptual models into practical recommendations
- Time-intensive process that may be difficult to implement in fast-paced commercial environments
- Relied heavily on the quality of stakeholder input and facilitator skill

Overall, SSM proved highly effective for understanding the complex socio-technical context of self-service kiosk errors. The rich picture technique was particularly valuable in visualizing the problem space and identifying systemic patterns that contribute to errors.

### Effectiveness of Usability Evaluation Methods

**Strengths:**
- Provided specific, actionable insights about interface design issues
- Offered standardized metrics for measuring usability and tracking improvements
- Combined quantitative and qualitative data for a comprehensive understanding
- Directly connected to established design principles and best practices

**Limitations:**
- Focused primarily on interface issues rather than broader systemic factors
- Laboratory-based evaluations may not fully capture real-world usage contexts
- Required access to representative users for meaningful results
- Some methods (like think-aloud protocols) can be resource-intensive

UEM proved highly effective for identifying specific usability issues in kiosk interfaces and providing clear guidance for design improvements. The combination of heuristic evaluation and user testing methods offered complementary insights that neither approach would provide alone.

### Effectiveness of Hierarchical Task Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Provided detailed understanding of the task structure and potential error points
- Revealed cognitive demands at each step of the interaction
- Identified specific subtasks where errors are most likely to occur
- Directly informed task flow redesign recommendations

**Limitations:**
- Primarily focused on planned, goal-directed behavior rather than exploratory use
- Required significant time to develop comprehensive task hierarchies
- May not fully capture emotional and social aspects of kiosk use
- Needed to be updated as interface designs change

HTA proved highly effective for breaking down complex kiosk interactions into manageable components and identifying specific points where errors are likely to occur. The structured nature of HTA made it particularly valuable for developing targeted interventions at critical error points.

### Effectiveness of Integrated Approach

The integration of these three approaches created a comprehensive framework that addressed the technical, cognitive, social, and organizational factors contributing to self-service kiosk errors. Key benefits of this integration included:

1. **Complementary perspectives**: Each approach addressed different aspects of the problem, creating a more complete understanding.

2. **Validation through triangulation**: Findings from one approach often confirmed and elaborated on insights from the others.

3. **Bridging levels of analysis**: The combination allowed movement between system-level insights and specific interface details.

4. **Balanced recommendations**: The integrated approach led to recommendations that addressed both immediate usability issues and underlying systemic factors.

The main challenge of the integrated approach was managing the complexity and volume of information generated. Future applications would benefit from more structured methods for synthesizing findings across approaches.

## Conclusion

### Summary of Key Findings

This report has examined the problem of errors in self-service kiosks through the application of three complementary human factors approaches. Key findings include:

1. Self-service kiosk errors emerge from complex interactions between users, technology, environment, and organizational factors, rather than from isolated design flaws.

2. Critical error points occur during initiation, navigation, customization, modification, and payment phases of kiosk interaction.

3. Cognitive load, anxiety, and accessibility barriers significantly contribute to error rates across diverse user populations.

4. Effective error reduction requires a multi-faceted approach addressing interface design, task flow, environmental factors, support systems, and organizational practices.

5. Continuous monitoring and improvement processes are essential for sustained error reduction over time.

### Implications for Practice

The findings and recommendations in this report have several important implications for organizations implementing self-service kiosks:

1. **Design philosophy**: Successful kiosk design requires shifting from a technology-centered to a human-centered approach that prioritizes error prevention and recovery.

2. **Inclusive design**: Designing for diverse users from the outset, rather than as an afterthought, reduces errors for all users while ensuring accessibility.

3. **Environmental context**: The physical and social environment significantly impacts kiosk usability and must be considered alongside interface design.

4. **Balanced automation**: Maintaining appropriate human support alongside self-service options creates a more resilient service system.

5. **Measurement beyond efficiency**: Evaluating success based on completion rates and user satisfaction, not just transaction speed, leads to better outcomes.

### Limitations and Future Research

This report has several limitations that suggest directions for future research:

1. **Implementation testing**: The recommendations would benefit from real-world testing and refinement in actual kiosk deployments.

2. **Cultural factors**: Further research is needed on how cultural differences affect kiosk usage patterns and error types.

3. **Longitudinal effects**: Studies of how users learn and adapt to self-service systems over time would provide valuable insights for design.

4. **Emerging technologies**: The impact of voice interfaces, contactless interaction, and artificial intelligence on kiosk errors warrants investigation.

5. **Business impact**: More research is needed on the relationship between error reduction and business outcomes like customer loyalty and revenue.

### Final Thoughts

Self-service kiosks will continue to play an increasingly important role in service delivery across multiple sectors. By applying human factors approaches to understand and address the sources of errors in these systems, organizations can create more inclusive, efficient, and satisfying experiences for all users.

The integration of Soft Systems Methodology, Usability Evaluation Methods, and Hierarchical Task Analysis provides a powerful framework for tackling this complex challenge. By addressing both the specific interface issues and the broader systemic factors that contribute to errors, organizations can develop self-service kiosks that truly serve the diverse needs of their users while achieving business objectives.

As technology continues to evolve, the fundamental principles of human-centered design remain constant: understand your users, design for their capabilities and limitations, test with diverse populations, and continuously improve based on real-world usage. By following these principles and applying the approaches outlined in this report, organizations can significantly reduce errors in self-service kiosks and create more positive experiences for all users.
